Wow amazing idea!

Your plan looks good to me. The user interface is clear and all actions have been specified. As long as you stick to the plan (from "Creating and Updating a Profile/ Logging In and Out", to "User Dashboard", and finally to "Matching Students with Mentors"), youâ€™ll finally get it done.

It actually requires a lot of work to get the web app fully implemented. Since there is a hard deadline for this project, I suggest you first finish some simple pieces of the functionalities on the plan, then use UML diagram and/or action diagram to help you organize (who does what), and if there is time, complete the web app.

Good luck!
